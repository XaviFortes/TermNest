# Password Authentication Testing

## Current Fix Status

I've implemented the following changes to fix the password authentication issue:

### Changes Made:

1. **Sessions Store Fix** (`src/stores/sessions.ts`):
   - Modified `connectToSession()` to skip backend connection for password auth
   - Added debugging to track the authentication flow
   - Password authentication now lets Terminal component handle connection

2. **Terminal Component Enhancement** (`src/components/Terminal.vue`):
   - Added proper password detection in `initializeTerminal()`
   - Enhanced debugging to track when password dialog should appear
   - Fixed authentication flow to always show dialog for password auth

3. **Session Card Debugging** (`src/components/SessionCard.vue`):
   - Added logging to track connection attempts
   - Shows authentication method being used

## Testing Steps:

1. **Create a Password Session**:
   - Click "+" to create new session
   - Select "Password" as authentication method
   - Fill in host, username, etc.
   - Save the session

2. **Test Connection**:
   - Click "Connect" on the password session
   - Watch the browser console for debugging output
   - You should see:
     ```
     SessionCard: Connecting to session: [id] Auth method: Password
     SessionStore: connectToSession called for: [id] Auth method: Password
     Password authentication detected - connection will be handled by Terminal component
     SessionCard: Connection attempt completed, opening session
     Password authentication detected in Terminal - showing password dialog
     ```

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Password dialog should appear immediately
   - No backend connection attempts with empty password
   - Dialog should show host and username information

## Current Issue Diagnosis:

If you're still seeing backend connection attempts without the password dialog, it means:
- The session's `auth_method` field might not be exactly equal to `'Password'`
- There might be another code path calling the old SSH connection
- The Terminal component might not be mounting properly

## Debug Information to Check:

When you click "Connect" on a password session, please check the browser console (F12) for:
1. The SessionCard debug output
2. The SessionStore debug output  
3. The Terminal component debug output
4. Any error messages

This will help us identify exactly where the flow is breaking.

## Next Steps:

Once we see the console output, we can determine if:
- The session auth method is being detected correctly
- The Terminal component is being mounted
- The password dialog is being triggered

The fix is in place, now we need to verify it's working as expected.
